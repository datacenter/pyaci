Introduction
============

Goals
-----

PyACI was designed with the following goals in mind.

#. Provide a set of minimal, intuitive, and consistent API constructs.
#. Provide a simple Python abstraction over ACI REST API, and managed objects.
#. Option to use XML or JSON payload.

Status
------

PyACI is not the official Python bindings for Cisco ACI. It is
provided as an alternative. For an official Python API, please look at
Cobra.

PyACI is in a very early stage of specification. The API could change
in minor ways based on the early adopters' comments. If you are using
it, please be prepared to adapt your code accordingly.
